Adenylosuccinate synthetase has been characterized from various sources ranging from Escherichia coli (gene purA) to vertebrate tissues. In vertebrates, two isozymes are present - one involved in purine biosynthesis and the other in the purine nucleotide cycle. The crystal structure of adenylosuccinate synthetase from E. coli reveals that the dominant structural element of each monomer of the homodimer is a central beta-sheet of 10 strands. The first nine strands of the sheet are mutually parallel with right-handed crossover connections between the strands. The 10th strand is antiparallel with respect to the first nine strands. In addition, the enzyme has two antiparallel beta-sheets, comprised of two strands and three strands each, 11 alpha-helices and two short 3/10-helices. Further, it has been suggested that the similarities in the GTP-binding domains of the synthetase and the p21ras protein are an example of convergent evolution of two distinct families of GTP-binding proteins PUBMED:8244965. Structures of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Triticum aestivum and Arabidopsis thaliana when compared with the known structures from E. coli reveals that the overall fold is very similar to that of the E. coli protein PUBMED:10669609."

AgrB,SM00793,"Accessory gene regulator B","The accessory gene regulator (agr) of Staphylococcus aureus is the central regulatory system that controls the gene expression for a large set of virulence factors. The arg locus consists of two transcripts: RNAII and RNAIII. RNAII encodes four genes (agrA, B, C, and D) whose gene products assemble a quorum sensing system. At low cell density, the agr genes are continuously expressed at basal levels. A signal molecule, autoinducing peptide (AIP), produced and secreted by the bacteria, accumulates outside of the cells. When the cell density increases and the AIP concentration reaches a threshold, it activates the agr response, i.e. activation of secreted protein gene expression and subsequent repression of cell wall-associated protein genes. AgrB and AgrD are essential for the production of the autoinducing peptide which functions as a signal for quorum sensing. AgrB is a transmembrane protein PUBMED:11195102. AgrB is involved in the proteolytic processing of AgrD and may have both proteolytic enzyme activity and a transporter facilitating the export of the processed AgrD peptide PUBMED:12122003."

The agr locus was initially described in Staphylococcus aureus as an element controlling the production of exoproteins implicated in virulence. Its pattern of action has been shown to be complex, upregulating certain extracellular toxins and enzymes expressed post-exponentially and repressing some exponential-phase surface components. AgrD encodes the precursor of the autoinducing peptide (AIP).The AIP derived from AgrD by the action of AgrB interacts with AgrC in the membrane to activate AgrA, which upregulates transcription both from promoter P2, amplifying the response, and from P3, initiating the production of a novel effector: RNAIII. In S. aureus, delta-hemolysin is the only translation product of RNA III and is not involved in the regulatory functions of the transcript, which is therefore the primary agent for modulating the expression of other operons controlled by agr PUBMED:11807079."

Alpha_L_fucos,SM00812,Alpha-L-fucosidase,"O-Glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-) are a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyse the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. A classification system for glycosyl hydrolases, based on sequence similarity, has led to the definition of 85 different families. This classification is available on the CAZy (CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes) web site PUBMED:. Because the fold of proteins is better conserved than their sequences, some of the families can be grouped in 'clans'. Family 29 encompasses alpha-L-fucosidases, which is a lysosomal enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing the alpha-1,6-linked fucose joined to the reducing-end N-acetylglucosamine of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins. Deficiency of alpha-L-fucosidase results in the lysosomal storage disease fucosidosis."

VP16 associates with cellular transcription factors to enhance transcription rates, including the general transcription factor TFIIB and the transcriptional coactivator PC4. The N-terminal residues of VP16 confer specificity for the IE genes, while the C-terminal residues are responsible for transcriptional activation. Within the C-terminal region are two activation regions that can independently and cooperatively activate transcription.

Amelin,SM00817,"Ameloblastin precursor (Amelin)","This family consists of several mammalian Ameloblastin precursor (Amelin) proteins. Matrix proteins of tooth enamel consist mainly of amelogenin but also of non-amelogenin proteins, which, although their volumetric percentage is low, have an important role in enamel mineralisation. One of the non-amelogenin proteins is ameloblastin, also known as amelin and sheathlin. Ameloblastin (AMBN) is one of the enamel sheath proteins which is though to have a role in determining the prismatic structure of growing enamel crystals."
Amelogenin,SM00818,,"Amelogenins, cell adhesion proteins, play a role in the biomineralisation of teeth. They seem to regulate formation of crystallites during the secretory stage of tooth enamel development and are thought to play a major role in the structural organisation and mineralisation of developing enamel. The extracellular matrix of the developing enamel comprises two major classes of protein: the hydrophobic amelogenins and the acidic enamelins. Circular dichroism studies of porcine amelogenin have shown that the protein consists of 3 discrete folding units: the N-terminal region appears to contain beta-strand structures, while the C-terminal region displays characteristics of a random coil conformation. Subsequent studies on the bovine protein have indicated the amelogenin structure to contain a repetitive beta-turn segment and a ""beta-spiral"" between Gln112 and Leu138, which sequester a (Pro, Leu, Gln) rich region. The beta-spiral offers a probable site for interactions with Ca2+ ions. Muatations in the human amelogenin gene (AMGX) cause X-linked hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta, a disease characterised by defective enamel. A 9bp deletion in exon 2 of AMGX results in the loss of codons for Ile5, Leu6, Phe7 and Ala8, and replacement by a new threonine codon, disrupting the 16-residue (Met1-Ala16) amelogenin signal peptide."

ARID,SM01014,"ARID/BRIGHT DNA binding domain","Members of the recently discovered ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) family of DNA-binding proteins are found in fungi and invertebrate and vertebrate metazoans. ARID-encoding genes are involved in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development, cell lineage gene regulation and cell cycle control. Although the specific roles of this domain and of ARID-containing proteins in transcriptional regulation are yet to be elucidated, they include both positive and negative transcriptional regulation and a likely involvement in the modification of chromatin structure PUBMED:10838570. The basic structure of the ARID domain domain appears to be a series of six alpha-helices separated by beta-strands, loops, or turns, but the structured region may extend to an additional helix at either or both ends of the basic six. Based on primary sequence homology, they can be partitioned into three structural classes: Minimal ARID proteins that consist of a core domain formed by six alpha helices; ARID proteins that supplement the core domain with an N-terminal alpha-helix; and Extended-ARID proteins, which contain the core domain and additional alpha-helices at their N- and C-termini."

B12-binding_2,SM01018,"B12 binding domain","Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase is a large modular protein that catalyses methyl transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) to homocysteine. During the catalytic cycle, it supports three distinct methyl transfer reactions, each involving the cobalamin (vitamin B12) cofactor and a substrate bound to its own functional unit PUBMED:11731805. The cobalamin cofactor plays an essential role in this reaction, accepting the methyl group from CH3-H4folate to form methylcob(III)alamin, and in turn donating the methyl group to homocysteine to generate methionine and cob(I)alamin. Methionine synthase is a large enzyme composed of four structurally and functionally distinct modules: the first two modules bind homocysteine and CH3-H4folate, the third module binds the cobalamin cofactor and the C-terminal module binds S-adenosylmethionine. The cobalamin-binding module is composed of two structurally distinct domains: a 4-helical bundle cap domain (residues 651-740 in the Escherichia coli enzyme) and an alpha/beta B12-binding domain (residues 741-896). The 4-helical bundle forms a cap over the alpha/beta domain, which acts to shield the methyl ligand of cobalamin from solvent PUBMED:8939751. Furthermore, in the conversion to the active conformation of this enzyme, the 4-helical cap rotates to allow the cobalamin cofactor to bind the activation domain. The alpha/beta domain is a common cobalamin-binding motif, whereas the 4-helical bundle domain with its methyl cap is a distinctive feature of methionine synthases."

The N-terminal portion of the (unpermuted) Cache domain contains three predicted strands that could form a sheet analogous to that present in the core of the PAS domain structure. Cache domains are particularly widespread in bacteria, with Vibrio cholerae. The animal calcium channel alpha-2delta subunits might have acquired a part of their extracellular domains from a bacterial source PUBMED:11084361. The Cache domain appears to have arisen from the GAF-PAS fold despite their divergent functions PUBMED:11292341."

CAs have essential roles in facilitating the transport of carbon dioxide and protons in the intracellular space, across biological membranes and in the layers of the extracellular space; they are also involved in many other processes, from respiration and photosynthesis in eukaryotes to cyanate degradation in prokaryotes. There are five known evolutionarily distinct CA families (alpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon) that have no significant sequence identity and have structurally distinct overall folds. Some CAs are membrane-bound, while others act in the cytosol; there are several related proteins that lack enzymatic activity. The active site of alpha-CAs is well described, consisting of a zinc ion coordinated through 3 histidine residues and a water molecule/hydroxide ion that acts as a potent nucleophile. The enzyme employs a two-step mechanism: in the first step, there is a nucleophilic attack of a zinc-bound hydroxide ion on carbon dioxide; in the second step, the active site is regenerated by the ionisation of the zinc-bound water molecule and the removal of a proton from the active site PUBMED:9336012.

Acetylation of Cm by CAT inactivates the antibiotic. A histidine residue, located in the C-terminal section of the enzyme, plays a central role in its catalytic mechanism. There is a second family of CAT PUBMED:1314803, evolutionary unrelated to the main family described above. These CAT belong to the bacterial hexapeptide-repeat containing-transferases family (see ). The crystal structure of the type III enzyme from Escherichia coli with chloramphenicol bound has been determined. CAT is a trimer of identical subunits (monomer Mr 25,000) and the trimeric structure is stabilised by a number of hydrogen bonds, some of which result in the extension of a beta-sheet across the subunit interface. Chloramphenicol binds in a deep pocket located at the boundary between adjacent subunits of the trimer, such that the majority of residues forming the binding pocket belong to one subunit while the catalytically essential histidine belongs to the adjacent subunit. His195 is appropriately positioned to act as a general base catalyst in the reaction, and the required tautomeric stabilisation is provided by an unusual interaction with a main-chain carbonyl oxygen PUBMED:2187098."
Catalase,SM01060,,"Catalases are antioxidant enzymes that catalyse the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen, serving to protect cells from its toxic effects PUBMED:11351128.

These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60."

Cullins are molecular scaffolds responsible for assembling the ROC1/Rbx1 RING-based E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which several play a direct role in tumorigenesis. Nedd8/Rub1 is a small ubiquitin-like protein, which was originally found to be conjugated to Cdc53, a cullin component of the SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/CUL1-F-box protein) E3 Ub ligase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Nedd8 modification has now emerged as a regulatory pathway of fundamental importance for cell cycle control and for embryogenesis in metazoans.

EF1_GNE,SM00888,"EF-1 guanine nucleotide exchange domain","Translation elongation factors are responsible for two main processes during protein synthesis on the ribosome. EF1A (or EF-Tu) is responsible for the selection and binding of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site (acceptor site) of the ribosome. EF2 (or EF-G) is responsible for the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site (peptidyl-tRNA site) of the ribosome, thereby freeing the A-site for the next aminoacyl-tRNA to bind. Elongation factors are responsible for achieving accuracy of translation and both EF1A and EF2 are remarkably conserved throughout evolution. Elongation factor EF1B (also known as EF-Ts or EF-1beta/gamma/delta) is a nucleotide exchange factor that is required to regenerate EF1A from its inactive form (EF1A-GDP) to its active form (EF1A-GTP). EF1A is then ready to interact with a new aminoacyl-tRNA to begin the cycle again. EF1B is more complex in eukaryotes than in bacteria, and can consist of three subunits: EF1B-alpha (or EF-1beta), EF1B-gamma (or EF-1gamma) and EF1B-beta (or EF-1delta). This entry represents the guanine nucleotide exchange domain of the beta (EF-1beta, also known as EF1B-alpha) and delta (EF-1delta, also known as EF1B-beta) chains of EF1B proteins from eukaryotes and archaea.

EF2 (or EF-G) is responsible for the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site (peptidyl-tRNA site) of the ribosome, thereby freeing the A-site for the next aminoacyl-tRNA to bind. Elongation factors are responsible for achieving accuracy of translation and both EF1A and EF2 are remarkably conserved throughout evolution. Elongation factor EF2 (EF-G) is a G-protein. It brings about the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA and mRNA through a ratchet-like mechanism: the binding of GTP-EF2 to the ribosome causes a counter-clockwise rotation in the small ribosomal subunit; the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by EF2 and the subsequent release of EF2 causes a clockwise rotation of the small subunit back to the starting position. This twisting action destabilises tRNA-ribosome interactions, freeing the tRNA to translocate along the ribosome upon GTP-hydrolysis by EF2. EF2 binding also affects the entry and exit channel openings for the mRNA, widening it when bound to enable the mRNA to translocate along the ribosome. EF2 has five domains. This entry represents domain IV found in EF2 (or EF-G) of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The EF2-GTP-ribosome complex undergoes extensive structural rearrangement for tRNA-mRNA movement to occur. Domain IV, which extends from the 'body' of the EF2 molecule much like a lever arm, appears to be essential for the structural transition to take place."

Domains I and III share an almost identical alpha-beta-alpha sandwich fold, while domain II forms an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich similar to that of bacterial flavodoxins. FAD is bound in a cleft between domains II and III, while domain III binds the AMP molecule. Interactions between domains I and III stabilise the protein, forming a shallow bowl where domain II resides. This entry represents the N-terminal domain of both the alpha and beta subunits from Group I and Group II ETFs."

Excalibur,SM00894,"Excalibur calcium-binding domain","Extracellular Ca2+-dependent nuclease YokF from Bacillus subtilis and several other surface-exposed proteins from diverse bacteria are encoded in the genomes in two paralogous forms that differ by a ~45 amino acid fragment, which comprises a novel conserved domain. Sequence analysis of this domain revealed a conserved DxDxDGxxCE motif, which is strikingly similar to the Ca2+-binding loop of the calmodulin-like EF-hand domains, suggesting an evolutionary relationship between them. Functions of many of the other proteins in which the novel domain, named Excalibur (extracellular calcium-binding region), is found, as well as a structural model of its conserved motif are consistent with the notion that the Excalibur domain binds calcium. This domain is but one more example of the diversity of structural contexts surrounding the EF-hand-like calcium-binding loop in bacteria. This loop is thus more widespread than hitherto recognised and the evolution of EF-hand-like domains is probably more complex than previously appreciated."

Fapy_DNA_glyco,SM00898,"Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase N-terminal domain","This entry represents the catalytic domain of DNA glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes, which are involved in base excision repair of DNA damaged by oxidation or by mutagenic agents. Most damage to bases in DNA is repaired by the base excision repair pathway PUBMED:15588838. These enzymes are primarily from bacteria, and have both DNA glycosylase activity and AP lyase activity. Examples include formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases (Fpg; MutM) and endonuclease VIII (Nei). Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases (Fpg, MutM) is a trifunctional DNA base excision repair enzyme that removes a wide range of oxidation-damaged bases (N-glycosylase activity; ) and cleaves both the 3'- and 5'-phosphodiester bonds of the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP lyase activity; ). Fpg has a preference for oxidised purines, excising oxidized purine bases such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). ITs AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity introduces nicks in the DNA strand, cleaving the DNA backbone by beta-delta elimination to generate a single-strand break at the site of the removed base with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates. Fpg is a monomer composed of 2 domains connected by a flexible hinge PUBMED:10921868. The two DNA-binding motifs (a zinc finger and the helix-two-turns-helix motifs) suggest that the oxidized base is flipped out from double-stranded DNA in the binding mode and excised by a catalytic mechanism similar to that of bifunctional base excision repair enzymes PUBMED:10921868. Fpg binds one ion of zinc at the C-terminus, which contains four conserved and essential cysteines PUBMED:8473347, PUBMED:7704272. Endonuclease VIII (Nei) has the same enzyme activities as Fpg above, but with a preference for oxidized pyrimidines, such as thymine glycol, 5,6-dihydrouracil and 5,6-dihydrothymine PUBMED:15232006. These protein contains three structural domains: an N-terminal catalytic core domain, a central helix-two turn-helix (H2TH) module and a C-terminal zinc finger (see PDB:1K82) PUBMED:11912217. The N-terminal catalytic domain and the C-terminal zinc finger straddle the DNA with the long axis of the protein oriented roughly orthogonal to the helical axis of the DNA. Residues that contact DNA are located in the catalytic domain and in a beta-hairpin loop formed by the zinc finger PUBMED:12055620."

This domain probably binds to a range of effector molecules that regulate the transcription of genes through the action of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain. This domain is found in and that are regulators of sugar biosynthesis operons. Many bacterial transcription regulation proteins bind DNA through a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, which can be classified into subfamilies on the basis of sequence similarities. The HTH GntR family has many members distributed among diverse bacterial groups that regulate various biological processes. It was named GntR after the Bacillus subtilis repressor of the gluconate operon. In general, these proteins contain a DNA-binding HTH domain at the N terminus, and an effector binding or oligomerisation domain at the C terminus. The winged-helix DNA-binding domain is well conserved in structure for the whole of the GntR family, and is similar in structure to other transcriptional regulator families. The C-terminal effector-binding and oligomerisation domains are more variable and are consequently used to define the subfamilies. Based on the sequence and structure of the C-terminal domains, the GtnR family can be divided into four major groups, as represented by FadR, HutC, MocR and YtrA, as well as some minor groups such as those represented by AraR and PlmA."

Fe_hyd_SSU,SM00902,"Iron hydrogenase small subunit","Many microorganisms, such as methanogenic, acetogenic, nitrogen-fixing, photosynthetic, or sulphate-reducing bacteria, metabolise hydrogen. Hydrogen activation is mediated by a family of enzymes, termed hydrogenases, which either provide these organisms with reducing power from hydrogen oxidation, or act as electron sinks. There are two hydrogenases families that differ functionally from each other: NiFe hydrogenases tend to be more involved in hydrogen oxidation, while Iron-only FeFe (Fe only) hydrogenases in hydrogen production. Fe only hydrogenases show a common core structure, which contains a moiety, deeply buried inside the protein, with an Fe-Fe dinuclear centre, nonproteic bridging, terminal CO and CN- ligands attached to each of the iron atoms, and a dithio moiety, which also bridges the two iron atoms and has been tentatively assigned as a di(thiomethyl)amine. This common core also harbours three [4Fe-4S] iron-sulphur clusters PUBMED:11921392. In FeFe hydrogenases, as in NiFe hydrogenases, the set of iron-sulphur clusters is dispersed regularly between the dinuclear Fe-Fe centre and the molecular surface. These clusters are distant by about 1.2 nm from each other but the [4Fe-4S] cluster closest to the dinuclear centre is covalently bound to one of the iron atoms though a thiolate bridging ligand. The moiety including the dinuclear centre, the thiolate bridging ligand, and the proximal [4Fe-4S] cluster is known as the H-cluster. A channel, lined with hydrophobic amino acid side chains, nearly connects the dinuclear centre and the molecular surface. Furthermore hydrogen-bonded water molecule sites have been identified at the interior and at the surface of the protein.

In addition, Mg+2 dependence and production of 3'-OH and 5' phosphate products are shared characteristics of RNaseH and RISC. The PIWI domain core has a tertiary structure belonging to the RNase H family of enzymes. RNase H fold proteins all have a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by helices. By analogy to RNase H enzymes which cleave single-stranded RNA guided by the DNA strand in an RNA/DNA hybrid, the PIWI domain can be inferred to cleave single-stranded RNA, for example mRNA, guided by double stranded siRNA."

RpoE2 is one of 13 subunits in the archaeal RNA polymerase. These proteins contain a C4-type zinc finger, and the structure has been solved (PMID:19000817). The structure reveals that Spt4-Spt5 binding is governed by an acid-dipole interaction between Spt5 and Spt4, and the complex binds to and travels along the elongating RNA polymerase. The Spt4-Spt5 complex is likely to be an ancient, core component of the transcription elongation machinery."
