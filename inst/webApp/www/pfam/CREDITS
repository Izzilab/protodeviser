The image generator, incorporated within ProToDeviser, is not created by
the ProToDeviseR authors. It is the Custom domains graphics generator
tool from the old, decomissioned Pfam web-site.

The modifications we did were: 
  * trimming down the index.html page
  * fixing broken links to domains description in the metadata
  * add the ability to change residue pixel size (domain_graphics.js),
    modify motif opacity, and fix X and Y scaling values to be the same
    (graphic_generator.js)

The different image generator components are lincensed under Apache-2,
CC-ND 3.0, GPLv2 (with permission to be used with future versions of the
license) and MIT.
